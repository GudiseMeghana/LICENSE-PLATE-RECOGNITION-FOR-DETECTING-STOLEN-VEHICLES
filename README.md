# License Plate Recognition & Stolen Vehicle Detection

This project implements a **real-time License Plate Recognition (LPR) system** using **YOLOv11** for detection and **PaddleOCR** for text recognition. The system can detect multiple vehicle license plates from images and videos, extract text, and cross-check with a stolen vehicle database.
